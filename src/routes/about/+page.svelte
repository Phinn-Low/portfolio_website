  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I am <strong>Phinnaeus Low</strong>, a second year computer science student with a passion for web development and AI, but also really anything involving programming. Over the past two years I've pushed myself by taking challenging <a href="/courses" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" sveltekit:prefetch>courses</a> and building engaging <a href="/projects" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" sveltekit:prefetch>projects</a>, and I'm always working on something new!
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of computer science, I love doing things outdoors, like mountain biking and jogging. I'm also studying Japanese (N4/N3 level) and hope to do a study abroad in Nagoya in Spring 2026.

    This site is my personal portfolio: you’ll find project write-ups, code samples on GitHub, and a way to get in touch if you’d like to collaborate or learn more.
